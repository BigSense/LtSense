controller.py - Finish RespawningController for use in production to respan if thread fails 
    Threading should be in a try and catch that resets if an unexpected excpetion occurs. 
    To prevent continuous respawning there should be a limit (n times in t time)
    present in the config file to limit the amount of times it tries to respawn before it gives up.
